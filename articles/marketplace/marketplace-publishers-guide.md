## Storefronts

Microsoft provides two distinct marketplace storefronts that allow partners to list offers, enable trials, and transact directly with Microsoft customers and ecosystem: [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com) and [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com). These storefronts enable customers to find, try, and buy applications and services that accelerate their digital transformation. They help publishers grow their businesses by increasing access to Microsoft customers and partner ecosystems.
 
Each storefront offers specialized publishing options to help you maximize your publishing investment. The following table summarizes these options:

### Go-To-Market Benefits

Azure Marketplace and AppSource allows publishers to showcase their solutions to millions of customers. New listings in the marketplace are automatically offered a set of free Go-To-Market benefits to help drive awareness of your offer to our customer ecosystem.

Listing your offer in the marketplace storefront is a launchpad for joint Go-To-Market activities with Microsoft and the doorway to a Co-sell Ready partnership opportunity. All new listings are automatically offered a set of no cost Go-To-Market benefits to help drive awareness of your offer to our customer ecosystem. The GTM benefits deliver a variety of co-marketing and co-sell activities designed to leverage our brand, channels and ecosystem to help partners drive awareness for their solution and generate sales. No action is required by partner. As soon as an offer is published, our GTM team will reach out to the partner to begin delivery.
For more information on our GTM benefits and ways to grow your business in the marketplace please visit [GTM benefits on the MPN site](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-US/reach-customers/gtm).


### Determine the Listing Type Right for Your Offer

Each storefront supports multiple publishing options and offer types. Select an offer type that best represents your application and service details. All publishing options will give partners access to lead sharing. 


#### List

Use Contact Me when trial-level or transaction-level participation is not feasible. The benefit of this approach is that it enables publishers with an in-market solution to immediately begin receiving leads that can be nurtured into the foundational deals to start your business flywheel. However, the drawback is that customer engagement is limited, as compared with other offer types.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Customer engagement is best with Trial and Transact offers. The value of Contact Me is the lead that you receive, so if you choose this type of listing, ensure that your lead destination is configured and you are ready to maximize the lead. 

When the offer consists primarily of professional services (for example, assessments, implementations, workshops), use the Consulting Services offer type. Offer scope, duration, and price must be fixed, must be for a single customer, and must be conducted on site.

#### Trial

Providing a trial experience increases the engagement level offered to customers and therefore a richer exposure of your solution. A trial enables customers to explore your solution before buying. With a trial experience, you will have higher chances of promotion in the storefronts, and you should expect more and richer leads from customer engagements.
 
All trial options are deployed to your trial environment and/or Azure subscription, rather than to the customer's environment or Azure subscription. Trials should be customer led without any additional purchases and minimal, if any, additional configuration to complete a simple use case. Trials must include free support at least for the duration of the trial period. Trial users should be nurtured and monitored along a deliberate evaluation path for best results. Publishers are encouraged to use both marketplace leads and the publisher's own in-app intelligence to monitor and manage trial users.

There are three typical trial scenarios:

**Free trial**

Use a free trial when the solution or app offers a free-to-try, SaaS-based trial. This option drives high-quality leads from interested customers, to help you start your business flywheel. Free trials can be presented as limited-use or limited-duration trial accounts. They should include a call to action for accelerating conversion to paid use of your software.

|**Trial option**  |**Key benefits**  |**Choose this option if...**  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|**Free trial**    |     Enables a customer to try your product before they buy with an automatic method to convert to paid use. Also enables proofs of concept for the customer and joint engagement with Microsoft sales teams. |     Your solution is a virtual machine or solution template.<br><br> Your solution is an SaaS offering and you offer a multitenant SaaS product. <br><br>You have a first-run experience to get a customer up and running quickly. <br><br>You have a single tenant but are adding customers as guest users.|

**Test Drive**

Use a test drive when the solution is deployed via one or more virtual machines through IaaS or SaaS apps. The benefit of this approach is the automated provisioning of a virtual appliance or entire solution environment couched in a partner-hosted "guided tour" of the solution for customer evaluation at no additional cost to the customer. The customer does not need to be an existing Azure customer, to help generate higher-quality leads.

There are additional benefits to a test drive:

- 27% of user searches on the marketplace are refined by users to only show offers with test drives. 
- Offers with test drives generate 38% more leads than offers without. 
- 36% of new customer acquisitions on the marketplace come from customers that took a test drive. 
- Test drives enable Microsoft field sellers to better understand your product for co-sell efforts.

|**Trial option**  |**Key benefits**  |**Choose this option if...**  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|**Test drive**     |     Enables a customer to try your product before they buy. Also provides a guided experience of your solution on a pre-configured setup. |   Your solution is a virtual machine, solution template, or SaaS app with a single tenant, or is complicated to provision. <br><br>You don't have a method to convert your trial to a paid offer. |

**Interactive Demo**

Take your customers through a guided experience of your product by using an interactive demo. The benefit of this option is that you can provide a trial experience without complicated provisioning for complex solutions. This option gives customers a look around the solution. And it enables publishers to begin receiving leads that can be nurtured into foundational deals to start your business flywheel. 

|**Trial option**  |**Key benefits**  |**Choose this option if...**  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|**Interactive demo**    |  Allows customers to see your product in action without the complexity of setup.       |    Your solution requires complex setup that would be hard to achieve in the trial period.     |

#### Transaction

In the Azure Marketplace, use a *virtual machine* when the solution is deployed as a virtual appliance to the customer's subscription. Virtual machines are fully commerce enabled via Pay-As-You-Go or BYOL-enabled licensing models. Microsoft hosts the commerce transaction and bills the customer on behalf of the publisher. The publisher gets the benefit of leveraging the customer's preferred payment relationship with Microsoft, including the Enterprise Agreement. 

>[!NOTE]
>At this time, an Enterprise Agreement's monetary commitments can be used against the virtual appliance's Azure usage, but not against the publisher's software license fees.

Use an *Azure solution template* when a solution requires additional deployment and configuration automation beyond the virtual appliance. Solution templates can automate the provisioning of one or more virtual machine resources and can provision networking and storage resources. Solution templates can provide automation benefits on single virtual machines and on entire IaaS-based solution environments. Learn more about building solution templates in [GitHub](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs).

Use an *Azure managed app* when you're deploying either a virtual machine or an entire IaaS-based solution to a customer's subscription--and the publisher or customer wants the solution to be managed by a third party (for example, an SI or MSP). Learn more about building managed apps in [Azure managed applications overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/managed-applications/overview). For a list of commonly asked questions, see [Marketplace FAQs](https://azure.microsoft.com/marketplace/faq/).

>[!NOTE]
> Managed apps must be deployable through the Marketplace. If customer communication is a concern, note that you can reach out to interested customers if you have lead sharing enabled.

#### Azure Certified program

All virtual machines published in the Azure Marketplace are tested for the Azure Certified program. The program:

- Assures customers that your virtual machine is compatible with the Azure platform and the Marketplace selling model.
- Tests for online image safety compliance, including viruses and malware.
- Enables badging at the offer level to enhance promotion to Microsoft enterprise customers as a validated solution.
- For more information please review [Microsoft Azure Certified](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/programs/certified/).

#### Using Azure Active Directory to enable trials
Azure Active Directory is a cloud identity service that enables authentication with a Microsoft work or school account by using industry-standard protocols: OAuth and OpenID Connect. Learn more about Azure AD on the [product webpage](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/azure-active-directory-features). 

Microsoft authenticates all Marketplace users with Azure AD. When an authenticated user clicks through your trial listing in the Marketplace and is redirected to your trial environment, you can provision the user directly into a trial without requiring an additional sign-in step. The [token that your app receives from Azure AD during authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-token-and-claims#sample-tokens) includes valuable user information that you can use to create a user account in your app. You can then automate the provisioning experience and increase the likelihood of conversion. 

Using Azure AD to enable one-click authentication to your app or trial:

- Streamlines the customer experience from Marketplace to trial. 
- Maintains the feel of an in-product experience, even when the user is redirected from the Marketplace to your domain or trial environment.
- Decreases the likelihood of abandonment on redirect because there's no additional sign-in step.
- Reduces deployment barriers for the large population of Azure AD users.

**Certify Your Azure AD Integration for the Marketplace: Multitenant Applications**

If you support Azure AD today:

- Register your application in the Azure portal.
- Enable the multitenancy support feature in Azure AD to get a one-click trial experience.
- [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-integrating-applications).

If you are new to Azure AD Federated SSO:

- Register your application in the Azure portal.
- Develop SSO with Azure AD by using [OpenID Connect](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-protocols-openid-connect-code) or [OAuth 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-protocols-oauth-code).
- Enable the multitenancy support feature in Azure AD to get a one-click trial experience.
- [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-devhowto-appsource-certified).

**Certify Your Azure AD Integration for the Marketplace: Single-Tenant Applications**

There are multiple options for single-tenant applications:

- Add users to your directory as guest users by using [Azure B2B](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-b2b-what-is-azure-ad-b2b).
- Manually provision trials for customers via Contact Me.
- Develop a per-customer test drive.
- Build a multitenant sample demo app with SSO.


### Become a Cloud Marketplace Publisher

#### Becoming a Publisher

In this section, we explain the steps to: <ul><li>Become a publisher in the Azure Marketplace and AppSource.</li><li>Gain access to the Cloud Partner Portal. You'll use that portal to build, publish, and maintain your offer.</li></ul>

**Process Overview**

|Marketplace registration step  |Time  |Description  |
|---------|---------|---------|
| 1. Register in Microsoft Partner Network | 15 min | Join the Microsoft Partner Network (MPN) to become an official Microsoft partner and receive additional benefits and support for being an Azure Marketplace Publisher. To register in MPN, please visit Microsoft Partner Network and click “Enroll.” You will be able to join your organization’s existing membership, if applicable, during registration. Once registered, take note of your organization’s MPN ID: we will ask for it to activate your publisher profile in Cloud Partner Portal (Step 3).      |
|2. Create a Microsoft ID     |   15 minutes      |  This Microsoft ID will be used to access the Cloud Partner Portal. This email address needs to be registered as a Microsoft ID and is used for both the Cloud Partner Portal (Step 3) and the Microsoft Developer Center (Step 4). The selected email address should preferably be in your corporate domain and controlled by your IT team. For guidelines prior to creating an ID, review the sections in Guidelines and How-Tos. |
|3. Submit the marketplace nomination form     |  1-3 days       | Nominate your organization to become a Microsoft Cloud Marketplace publisher. The form includes information about your organization, the first application or service offer you would like to publish, and the level of support that you will provide. <ul><li>[Azure Marketplace nomination form](http://aka.ms/listonazuremarketplace)</li><li>[AppSource nomination form](http://aka.ms/listonappsource)</li></ul> After you submit the form, the Marketplace team will review the application and validate the request. After the request is reviewed, you will be notified via email with the next steps for becoming an approved partner and accessing the Cloud Partner Portal, where you can complete your first offer listing and create additional offers. If approved, you will also receive a promotional code to waive the registration fee for Microsoft Development Center (Step 4). |
|4. Register in the Developer Center     |    5-10 days     | The Microsoft Developer Center is required for publishing applications that will have transact capabilities in the marketplace, such as Virtual Machines, Solution Templates and Azure Managed Apps. This requirement will allow Microsoft to validate your company information company's legal, tax and banking entities. The registrant must be a valid representative of the organization and must provide personal information to validate identity. The person registering must use a Microsoft ID (Step 2) that is shared for the company, and the same account must be used in the Cloud Partner Portal. <ul>Note that if you haven't completed the marketplace nomination form, you'll be asked to pay a $99 registration fee. To have this fee waived, complete the marketplace nomination form and you'll receive a promotional code via email. Important: Before you try to create a Microsoft Developer Center account, make sure your company doesn't already have one. For a step-by-step explanation of this process, see Instructions on how to register in the Developer Center.</ul>   |
|5. Sign in to the Cloud Partner Portal     |  15 minutes       |  Once the Nomination has been approved and you have registered in the [Microsoft Partner Network](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/membership/) and in [Microsoft Developer Center](https://dev.windows.com/), an account will be created for you to access the [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/). First-time sign-in credentials will be included in the Nomination approval email. For detailed information on how to use the Cloud Partner Portal, go to the [Learn](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/#Learn) menu in the portal and review the Documentation section.    |


#### Guidelines and How-Tos

**Guidelines for creating a Microsoft ID to manage an Azure Marketplace account**

When you're creating a company account, follow these guidelines if more than one person will need to access the account by logging in with the Microsoft account that opened the account.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>To allow multiple users to access your Developer Center account, we recommend using Azure Active Directory to assign roles to individual users. These users can access the account by signing in with their individual Azure AD credentials. For more information, see [Guidance for Microsoft IDs in an Azure AD federated domain](#guidance-for-microsoft-ids-in-an-azure-ad-federated-domain). Create your Microsoft account by using an email address that belongs to your company's domain, but not to an individual. An example is windowsapps@fabrikam.com.

- Limit access to this Microsoft account to the smallest possible number of developers.
- Set up a corporate email distribution list that includes everyone who needs to access the developer account, and add this email address to your security information. This allows all the employees on the list to receive security codes when needed and to manage your Microsoft account's security information. If setting up a distribution list is not feasible, the owner of the individual email account needs to be available to access and share the security code when prompted. (For example, the owner is prompted when new security information is added to the account or when it must be accessed from a new device.)
- Add a company phone number that does not require an extension and is accessible to key team members.
- In general, have developers use trusted devices to sign in to your company's developer account. All key team members should have access to these trusted devices. This access will reduce the need for security codes to be sent when someone is accessing the account.
- If you need to allow access to the account from a non-trusted PC, limit that access to a maximum of five developers. Ideally, these developers should access the account from machines that share the same geographical and network location.
- Frequently review your company's security information on the [management page](https://account.live.com/proofs/Manage) to make sure it's all current.

Your developer account should be accessed primarily from trusted PCs. This is critical because there's a limit to the number of codes generated per account, per week. Using trusted PCs also enables the most seamless sign-in experience.

For more information on additional developer account guidelines and security, see [Opening a developer account](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/publish/opening-a-developer-account).

### Guidance for Microsoft IDs in an Azure AD federated domain

Your corporate account can be federated through [Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/). It will return an error if you try to create a Microsoft ID with a corporate email address. If you get an error, first check with your IT team to make sure this is the case. This is a known issue, and we are working on resolving it. 

As a workaround, we recommend that you create a new email address in the @outlook.com domain and create a rule. Follow these steps:

1. Go to the [signup page](https://signup.live.com/signup) and select **Get a new email address**.


2. Create the new email address and enter a password. This step creates both a new Microsoft ID and an email mailbox in the outlook.com service. Continue the registration process until the account is created.

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >Ensure that the email ID or distribution list that you will use for registering in the Developer Center is registered as a Microsoft account. (We recommend a distribution list to remove dependency from individuals.) If not, [register now](https://signup.live.com/signup?uaid=e479342fe2824efeb0c3d92c8f961fd3&lic=1).
   >
   >Also, *any email ID under the Microsoft company domain* cannot be used for Developer Center registration.

3. After you create the Microsoft ID with this account, sign in to the account [mailbox](https://outlook.live.com/owa/). [Create an email forwarding rule](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Use-rules-in-Outlook-Web-App-to-automatically-forward-messages-to-another-account-1433e3a0-7fb0-4999-b536-50e05cb67fed) to move all the emails on this mailbox to the email address that you created in your domain to manage the Azure Marketplace account.

After you complete the last step, Outlook will send all emails/communications from the Microsoft ID to your email account in your domain. You need to use the @outlook.com email address to authenticate in both the Microsoft Developer Center and the Cloud Partner Portal.

### Instructions on how to register in the Developer Center

1. Open a new Internet Explorer InPrivate or Chrome Incognito browsing session to ensure that you're not signed in to a personal account.
2. Go to the [Developer Center](http://dev.windows.com/registration?accountprogram=azure) to register yourself as a seller.
3. Complete the **Help us protect your account** wizard, which will verify your identity via phone number or email address.

   ![Boxes for phone info in the "Help us protect your account" wizard](./media/marketplace-publishers-guide/registerdevcenteremail.png)

4. In the **Registration-Account Info** section, select your account country/region from the drop-down menu.

   ![Account info with box for country/region](./media/marketplace-publishers-guide/devcenterregistrationaccountinfo.png)
   
   >[!WARNING]
   >To sell your services on the Azure Marketplace, make sure that your registered entity is from one of the approved "sell-from" countries. This restriction is for payout and taxation reasons. For more information, see the [Marketplace participation policies](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/marketplace/participation-policies/).

5. For **Account Type**, select **Company** and then select the **Next** button.

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >To better understand account types and which is best for you to choose, see [Account types, locations, and fees](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/publish/account-types-locations-and-fees).

6. For **Publisher display name**, enter the display name (typically the name of your company).

   >[!TIP]
   >The publisher display name entered in the Developer Center is not displayed in the Azure Marketplace after your offer is listed. But you must fill this box to complete the registration process.

7. For **Contact info**, enter the information for the account verification.

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >You must provide accurate contact information. The verification process will use it for approving your company in the Developer Center.

8. For **Company Approver**, enter the contact information for the approver. The approver is the person who can verify that you are authorized to create an account in the Developer Center on behalf of your organization. Select **Next** when you're finished.

   !["Account info" page with sections highlighted](./media/marketplace-publishers-guide/devcenterregistrationpayment.png)

9. Enter your payment information to pay for your account. If you have a promo code that covers the cost of registration, you can enter that here. Otherwise, provide your credit card information, or PayPal information in supported markets. When you're finished, select **Next**.

   ![Developer Center payment information](./media/marketplace-publishers-guide/devcenterregistrationpayment2.png)

10. Review your account information and confirm that everything is correct. Then, read and accept the terms and conditions of the Microsoft Azure Marketplace publisher agreement. Select the box to indicate that you have read and accepted these terms.
11. Select **Finish** to confirm your registration. We'll send a confirmation message to your email address.
12. If you're planning to publish only free offers, select **Go to the Cloud Partner Portal**.

    If you're planning to publish commercial (transaction) offers--for example, virtual machine offers with an hourly billing model--select **Update your account information**. Then you must fill in the bank and tax information in your Developer Center account, as described in the next section.

#### Add bank and tax information

If you want to publish commercial offers for purchase, you also need to add payout and tax information and submit it for validation in the Developer Center. If you will publish only free or BYOL offers, you don't need to add this information. You can add it later, but it takes some time to validate the tax information. If you know that you will offer commercial offers for purchase, we recommend that you add it as soon as possible.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>For commercial (transaction) offers, you can't push your offers to production until you complete the bank and tax information.

To add bank information:
1. Sign in to the Microsoft Developer Center with your Microsoft account.
2. Select **Payout account** on the left menu. Under **Choose payment method**, select **Bank account** or **PayPal**.

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >If you have commercial offers that customers purchase in the Marketplace, this is the account where you will receive payout for those purchases.

3. Enter the payment information, and select **Save** when you're satisfied.

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >If you need to update or change your payout account, follow the same preceding steps, but replace the current information with the new information. Changing your payout account can delay your payments by up to one payment cycle. This delay occurs because we need to verify the account change, just as we did when you first set up the payout account. You'll still get paid for the full amount after your account has been verified. Any payments due for the current payment cycle will be added to the next one.

4. Select **Next**. 

To add tax information:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Developer Center](https://dev.windows.com) with your Microsoft account (if needed).
2. Select **Tax profile** on the left menu.
3. On the **Set up your tax form** page, select the country or region where you have permanent residency, and then select the country or region where you hold primary citizenship. Select **Next**.
4. Enter your tax details, and then select **Next**.

If you have issues with Developer Center registration, log a support ticket:

1. Go to the [support page](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/support).
2. Under **Contact Us**, select the **Submit an incident** button.

   !["Submit an incident" button](./media/marketplace-publishers-guide/devcentersubmitincident.png)

3. Select **Help with Dev Center** as **Problem type**, and select **Publish and manage apps** as **Category**. After that, select the **Start email** button.   
4. On the sign-in page, use any Microsoft account to sign in. If you don't have a Microsoft account, create one by using the link. 
5. Fill in the details of the issue, and submit the ticket by selecting the **Submit** button.

#### Billing Options

**Marketplace Commercial Considerations**

There are no fees for participating in the Marketplace. There is no revenue share for participating in the Marketplace when you're publishing by using the list, trial, and BYOL transaction options. For more information, see the [Marketplace participation policies](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/marketplace/participation-policies/).

**Pay-As-You-Go and Bring Your Own License Billing Options**

When you use a Pay-As-You-Go transaction as a publishing option, your usage-based software licensing revenue is shared 80%/20% between you and Microsoft, respectively. A single offer can be priced at both Pay-As-You-Go and Bring Your Own License billing models, and can coexist at the offer level as separate SKUs. You can configure this in your offer in the Cloud Partner Portal.

Consider the following example.

If you enable Pay-As-You-Go as an option:


|Your license cost   | $1.00 per hour        |
|---------|---------|
|Azure usage cost (D1/1-Core)     | $0.14 per hour  |
|**Customer is billed by Microsoft**    | **$1.14 per hour**       |

In this scenario, Microsoft bills $1.14 per hour for use of your published virtual machine image.


|**Microsoft bills** |**$1.14 per hour**  |
|---------|---------|
|Microsoft pays you 80% of your license cost | $0.80 per hour        |
|Microsoft keeps 20% of your license cost    | $0.20 per hour        |
|Microsoft keeps the Azure usage cost     |   $0.14 per hour      |

Conversely, if you enable Bring Your Own License as an option:

|Your license cost     | License fee negotiated and billed by publisher        |
|---------|---------|
|Azure usage cost (D1/1-Core)    | $0.14 per hour         |
|**Customer is billed by Microsoft**     | **$0.14 per hour**        |

In this scenario, Microsoft bills $0.14 per hour for use of your published virtual machine image. 

|**Microsoft bills**    |   **$0.14 per hour**      |
|---------|---------|
|Microsoft keeps the Azure usage cost     |    $0.14 per hour     |
|Microsoft keeps 0% of your license cost     |  $0.00 per hour       |

**Single-billing and Payment Methods**

An important benefit of using the transaction publishing option is that Microsoft can single-bill your license costs at the same time as the underlying Azure usage directly to the customer. In this scenario, Microsoft bills and collects on your behalf, eliminating the need for you to create your own procurement relationship with the customer. This can save you time and resources to focus on landing the sale, not collecting the bill.

**Enterprise Agreement**

Microsoft customers sometimes use an Enterprise Agreement to pay for Microsoft products, including Azure usage. This payment option is designed for organizations that want to license software and cloud services for a minimum three-year period. Customers have the option to spread payments instead of one making up-front payment. When an EA customer uses Pay-As-You-Go transaction listing, billing for the publisher's software license costs follows the quarterly EA overage billing cycle.

**Monetary Commitment** 

Any Enterprise Agreement customer can add Azure to their agreement by making an upfront monetary commitment to Azure. That commitment is consumed throughout the year by using any combination of the wide variety of cloud services that Azure offers from its global datacenters.


### Azure Marketplace vs. AppSource

Each storefront serves unique customer needs. It enables targeting by role, so you can offer the right solution or service based on who your customer is.

Engage IT pros and cloud developers through the **Azure Marketplace** to discover, try, and buy IaaS, SaaS, and PaaS solutions:


|**Customer Need**  |**Azure Marketplace** |
|---------|---------|
|**Demands additional cloud platform functionality to meet business and technical needs**     |  Offers a growing portfolio of complementary applications and services optimized to run on Azure       |
|**Finds it challenging to discover the right application or service**    |  Provides a one-stop shop to discover, try, and buy solutions and services for Azure        |
|**Needs a scalable deployment mechanism for third-party applications and services**   | Enables the creation and configuration of scalable deployments for third-party applications and services        |
|**Requires new applications and services to integrate and work with existing solutions**  |   Easily integrates third-party applications and services with existing solutions on Azure      |

Engage business users on **AppSource** to find, try, and get line-of-business SaaS applications and implementation services to help drive business results and reduce time to value: 


|**Customer Need**  |**AppSource**  |
|---------|---------|
|**Business solutions that work with Microsoft products they already use** | Enables customers to use third-party applications and services to extend Microsoft cloud applications and technologies       |
|**Ability to easily find the right solution or implementation service.**    |   Provides a one-stop shop to discover, try, and get applications and services, add-ins, and more      |
|**Industry-specific line-of-business solutions to address their specific business challenges**   | Provides finished end-to-end industry solutions to help address specific requirements across many industries     |
|**Apps to help improve productivity, efficiency, and business insights**    | Provides apps for lines of business, including customer service, HR, operations, and many more        |
| **Experienced implementation partner to help adapt apps to their unique situation** | Provides a catalog of Consulting Services offerings for solutions based on Dynamics 365, Power BI, PowerApps, and third-party apps to help business users deliver predictable outcomes |

#### Understanding the Differences Between Storefronts

Choosing a storefront starts with identifying the target audience for your offer. If your solution targets both audiences, you need to publish only once to list in both storefronts.
 
Consider the additional benefits of each storefront:

|Storefront benefit  |Azure Marketplace  |AppSource   |
|---------|---------|---------|
|**Billing flexibility**    | For virtual machines, Pay-As-You-Go billing options use Microsoft Enterprise Agreements (EAs) or web direct sales models. Pricing options also include a Free Tier subscription where an offering is perpetually free. They also include a Try It Now subscription that is promotionally free for a limited period, after which it's converted to a paid subscription. Bring Your Own License activation is also an option for supporting publishers. <br><br>For both billing options, in scenarios where virtual machines are deployed via Azure apps (for example, a solution template or managed app), all provisioned Azure resources are billed directly to the customer. | AppSource offers provisioning of a trial experience but does not currently offer a commerce-enabled publishing option. You can use your current ordering and billing infrastructure with no additional investment or changes.        |
|**Facilitation of connections with other partners**     |The Azure Marketplace does not currently allow the publisher to link a service provider or delivery partners to the offer, but will launch this functionality in 2018.         |  Independent software vendors, systems integrators, and managed service providers can be linked for specific implementation scenarios. This ability supports collaborative selling to new customers.      |
|**Automation**     |    The Azure Marketplace does not currently allow the publisher to link a service provider or delivery partners to the offer.     | Take advantage of automated SaaS with add-in provisioning. Use solution templates to automate SaaS-based data collection and deployment scenarios.        |Independent software vendors, systems integrators, and managed service providers can be linked for specific implementation scenarios, supporting collaborative selling to new customers.
|**Multiple cloud types**     |   Publish both public cloud and on-premises solutions through Azure Stack, or publish to Azure Government and regional clouds, including China and Germany.      |    AppSource does not currently offer support for Azure Stack, Azure Government, or regional clouds.     |
|**In-context presentation to customers**     |  Make your solution available in the Azure in-portal experience for contextual search (virtual machines and solution templates).       |  Reach more customers through the in-app experience for Microsoft products such as Dynamics 365, Power BI, and Office 365.    |
